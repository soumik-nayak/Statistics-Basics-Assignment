        "# A:\n",
        "# Data can be qualitative (categorical) or quantitative (numerical).\n",
        "# Qualitative data describes categories or qualities, e.g., colors (red, blue), types of fruit.\n",
        "# Quantitative data is numerical, e.g., age, height.\n",
        "# - Nominal scale: Categories without order (e.g., gender, eye color).\n",
        "# - Ordinal scale: Ordered categories (e.g., rankings, satisfaction levels).\n",
        "# - Interval scale: Numerical values with equal intervals but no true zero (e.g., temperature in Celsius).\n",
        "# - Ratio scale: Numerical values with a true zero (e.g., weight, height, age).\n",

        "# Q2: What are the measures of central tendency, and when should you use each? Discuss the mean, median, and mode with examples and situations where each is appropriate.\n",
        "# A:\n",
        "# Measures of central tendency summarize a dataset with a single value.\n",
        "# - Mean: The arithmetic average. Use when data is symmetric without extreme outliers. Example: average test score.\n",
        "# - Median: The middle value. Best for skewed data or data with outliers. Example: median income.\n",
        "# - Mode: The most frequent value. Useful for categorical data. Example: most common shoe size sold.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Q3: Explain the concept of dispersion. How do variance and standard deviation measure the spread of data?\n",
        "# A:\n",
        "# Dispersion describes how spread out data values are.\n",
        "# - Variance measures the average squared deviation from the mean. Higher variance means more spread.\n",
        "# - Standard deviation is the square root of variance, showing spread in the same units as the data.\n",
        "# Both indicate how much values differ from the mean.\n",

        "# Q4: What is a box plot, and what can it tell you about the distribution of data?\n",
        "# A:\n",
        "# A box plot is a graphical summary of data showing the median, quartiles, and potential outliers.\n",
        "# It displays the interquartile range (IQR) as the box and whiskers extending to min/max within 1.5*IQR.\n",

        "# A:\n",
        "# Random sampling ensures every member of a population has an equal chance of selection.\n",

        "# A:\n",
        "# Skewness measures asymmetry in a distribution.\n",
        "# - Positive skew: Tail extends to the right; mean > median.\n",
        "# - Negative skew: Tail extends to the left; mean < median.\n",
        "# Skewness affects interpretation as mean is sensitive to skew, while median is more robust.\n",

        "# Q7: What is the interquartile range (IQR), and how is it used to detect outliers?\n",
        "# A:\n",

        "# - ~95% within ±2 SD.\n",
